            <h2>Pokéval Description and Functionality</h2>

                <h3>Evaluation by Pokémon</h3>
                <p>
                    You type in the name of the Pokémon you're battling against<br>
                    (Either in English or German)<br>
                    and then press ENTER or click 'confirm'<br>
                    to get shown the types in the effectiveness-category you selected.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Remember that certain abilities have a major impact on the immunity of<br>
                    certain attacks of a type.<br>
                    (For example: Pokémon with 'levitate' are immune to almost all Ground attacks)<br>
                    These might be added in a future update.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Evaluation by Type</h3>
                <p>
                    You type in the Mono- or Dualtype you'd like to check (in English)<br>
                    and then press ENTER or click 'confirm'. <br>
                    Typing in the same type twice is considered an invalid entry.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is basically the effectiveness chart<br>
                    in a more manageable way. It is useful when you<br>
                    are struggling to remember which types a particular type<br>
                    is effective or not effective against.

                    Or an entry might not work. <br>
